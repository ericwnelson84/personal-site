TODO
- set up template and instance with cfn helper script cfn-init and cfn-hup so I can update the metadata (user data) without having to restart the instance. I need the cfn hup config file
and need to update the template format to have meta-data. Need to look at examples in my notes
- set up cloudwatch log reporting from EC2
- Set up different deployment methods. Rolling etc
- Find python code from my 100 days of python projects webdriver with selenium its called where you use the xpath to click buttons on webpages. The GHost inspector is too expensive. Need to write a lambda function
- set up health check reporting from App path /health-check return 200. Need to change ASG health check from EC2 status to ELB. Also need to check the TG health check path

git remote get-url origin

aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace AWS/EC2 --region us-east-1

commands to intall cloudwatch agent and set up reporting to cloudwatch
- generate config file. there is a amazon-cloudwatch-agent-config-wizard but you have to launch it from the EC2 instance

sudo yum install -y amazon-cloudwatch-agent

sudo amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m ec2 -c file:config.json -s # this command should fetch the config file and starts the cloudwatch agent
